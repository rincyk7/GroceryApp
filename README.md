# 🛒 Grocery Application Automation Testing

This repository contains an end-to-end Selenium automation framework built to test a web-based Grocery Application. The project follows the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern with TestNG, Maven, and data-driven testing using Excel.

The framework automates critical user and admin workflows such as login, user management, product handling, cart operations, and validation of UI elements across different browsers. It is designed to be scalable, maintainable, and CI/CD–ready with Jenkins integration.
